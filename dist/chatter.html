            Welcome to the new Single Sign-on page for HireRight's Salesforce instance - HireForce! Please bookmark this new location so you can easily reference it as-needed (eventually, the old login, login.salesforce.com will be retired).
            <br>
            <br> HireRight is now embracing Salesforce Chatter - it represents an enterprise social network that connects every employee with the files, data, and experts they need.

                    Use Chatter to connect and collaborate with your teammates around the world. In Chatter, you can join groups, ask questions, follow your colleagues and company leaders and much more. Chatter is an internal business collaboration tool, but that doesn't mean we can’t have some fun with it.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>You manage your profile and everything in it, including the information you share. We want everyone to be a part of our Chatter network, and we all want to do the right thing. So we expect you to follow these simple guidelines:
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 hr">
                    <span class="attention">Be you</span>. Use your real name and photo, and complete your profile with a short, informal bio. Chatter is about getting to know everyone. You must have an active company email address to join our network.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 hr">
                    <span class="attention">Be responsible</span>. Don’t post or share info restricted by legal requirements or customer contracts, especially SPI. Avoid comments on unannounced deals, trade secrets, or confidential information. Remember that you’re still responsible for complying with all other HireRight policies, including privacy, social media and our code of conduct.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 hr">
                    <span class="attention">Be smart</span>. Everyone sees your posts. So use good judgment and stick to non-sensitive information. Never post candidates’ personally identifiable information (name, SSN, DOB, etc.). And remember that what you post stays online—make sure it reflects well on you and your teammates.

                <div class="col-md-12 hr">
                    <span class="attention">Be thoughtful</span>. Have a clear goal and audience in mind when you post. Should your message be public or are you really just asking a specific person a question? Remember that not all teams monitor Chatter, so if you are experiencing a problem with a particular product or service you should direct those messages using the appropriate channel for that issue.

                    <span class="attention">Be constructive</span>. Before you post, ask yourself: "Would I say this to John Fennelly in front of a couple thousand people?"

                    <span class="attention">Be open</span>. Collaborate for the best solutions. Invite conversation from other areas of the company. Give colleagues the opportunity to be interested and connect by forming public groups unless you have a clear need for a private group.
